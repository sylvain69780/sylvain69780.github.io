IQ's blog is very well known for the Shadertoy's users, but it is also interesting to look of the page of this associate in the creation of Shadertoy.
[Pol Jeremias Vila](http://www.poljeremias.com/#about)

Shadertoy has been designed from the origin as a social media that enables **graphics enthusiasts** to create and share computer graphics knowledge.

Mainly the spirit of Shadertoy is closely related to the **demoscene**. Looking at Wikipedia you will have a good explanation of what it is.
