# Vesica piscis

Mathematic and art are related. A new proof is this very simple shape that is the intersection of 2 identical circles. 

It's the first shape from the IQ's 2D SDF catalog that I used to create the ovoid shape of a rocket.

# Flower of life Sphere

While browsing for pictures on Google, I found on the Nina Design website a very interesting pendant. Clearly based on the Icosahedral symetry, but having Vesicas replacing the edges.

I also noted the **flockaroo's shader** that uses terahedral distance to create a shape. 

A lot os usefull functions to reuse here. 

Tricks to make weaving and coils are also present. And so more. All at 60 fps.

# Final result

I spend some time to find the simple formula used to calculate the position of a circle intersecting a plan and a sphere.
