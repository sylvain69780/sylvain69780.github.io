There is for me a true analogy with "magicians", in the way we are giving the best illusion to our brain that there is something real on the screen. 

It is very funny to trick our perceptions of shapes and colors.

This is totally the purpose of René Magritte in his provoking painting : "Ceci n'est pas une pipe".

The artist concentrated all his effort to created a reallistic image, and at the end breaks the illusion.

This is sometimes used by predators to hunt their prey.
