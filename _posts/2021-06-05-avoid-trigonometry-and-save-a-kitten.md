# Avoid trigonometry and save a kitten

These articles of IQ about using vectors operations (dot and cross products) instead of trigonometry function interested me.  
Developers are not always motivated to make high-performance code. But if it's about saving kittens, maybe they'll make the effort?  
That's what Inigo thinks in this article.

> This kitten is my neighbour's. And he's not dead despite appearances, but he sleeps peacefully while I leave for work.

This first article makes you know the relation between cos and dot product and sin and cross product.

This second one makes you understand the formulas   

```
sin(α + β)=sin(α) * cos(β) + cos(α) * sin(β)
cos(α + β)=cos(α) * cos(β) - sin(α) * sin(β)
```
