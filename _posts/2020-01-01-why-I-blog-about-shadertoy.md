title: "Why I felt the need to blog about Shadertoy"
tags: shadertoy

The initial idea of this blog is to references some usefull information I found concerning Shadertoy.

There is about 50 000 shaders published, and the code is accessible but seems like magic stuffs if you don't know the theory behind. My idea is to reference the ones that I studied in details or just noticed for later.

Again, as Shadertoy is a kind of rabbit hole, this led me to write about several related things.

I think that you don't need to be an senior programmer in order to start with shadertoy. The proof is that I'am not working as a developer currenlty. It's far simplier to learn GLSL than to learn to play Piano for example (I tried).

This may be a great initiation for young programmers, the same way I did my firt programs on my ATARI 520 ST. 

But in order to really get fun, you should interested in maths, problems, aesthetic in curves, nature and science in general. This is at least my opinion.

You need also to learn some mathematical basis teached in engeneer's preparation schools.

You should be also sensible to short programming and **performance optimization**. It's more programming for **physicians** than for business software engeneers. For this, **you should be informed about the underlying hardware architecture**. (the GPU)
