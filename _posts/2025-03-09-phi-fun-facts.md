## The Unexpected Connection of Phi and Icosahedrons

Phi is the positive solution of the quadratic equation

$$
x^2 = x + 1
$$

It is the proportion between a and b that allows a/b = (a+b)/a.
[Golden ratio - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio)

$$
\Phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
$$

This implies some noticables properties.

$$
\Phi \approx 1.618034
$$

$$
\frac{1}{\Phi} = \Phi - 1 \approx 0.618034
$$

$$
\Phi^2 = \Phi+1 \approx 2.618034
$$


Shane, a well-known Shadertoy user, recently shared an intuitive method to construct an icosahedron using three perpendicular golden rectangles.

From the reading of Divine Proportion [Luca Pacioli 1509] we deduce that some mathematicians of that time knew the golden relationships in the icosahedron thoroughly.

Phi is renowned for its ability to create homogeneous spacing of points on a surface, making it invaluable in various graphical applications.

However, using Phi as a building block for an icosahedron is quite unexpected.

Interestingly, Phi also appears in the dimensions of a pentagon, as Phi equals 2 * cos(π/5).

$$
\Phi = 2 \cdot \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)
$$

This is visible in the triangle below that can be used as a building block for a penthagon.

    <path d="M 50 190 A 20 20 0 0 0 40 170" fill="none" stroke="black" stroke-width="2"/>

**This seems to be just a pure coincidence**, as it does not appear evident in the definition of Phi as the solution of a quadratic equation.

### References on Phi in Architecture

Phi has fascinated many generations, especially for its use in architecture to achieve harmonious proportions.

### A Word of Caution

While Phi's presence in various fields is indeed fascinating, it is important to exercise caution and avoid overextending its significance. This tendency, known as concordism, can lead to seeing Phi everywhere, even where it may not have any meaningful relevance.

### Political influence

It's worth noting that Phi is also the symbol used by the LFI, a French ultra-left party. This association is unfortunate, as it links such a remarkable mathematical constant to a political group that some may find disagreeable.

### Conclusion

Shane's explanation not only sheds light on the geometric construction but also underscores the surprising and multifaceted nature of Phi in both mathematics and graphics.
