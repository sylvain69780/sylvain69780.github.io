## The Unexpected Connection of Phi and Icosahedrons

Shane, a well-known Shadertoy user, recently shared an intriguing method to construct an icosahedron using three perpendicular golden rectangles. This approach highlights the fascinating properties of the golden number (Phi) in computer graphics.

Phi is renowned for its ability to create homogeneous spacing of points on a surface, making it invaluable in various graphical applications.

However, using Phi as a building block for an icosahedron is quite unexpected. Interestingly, Phi also appears in the dimensions of a pentagon, as Phi equals 2 * cos(π/5).

$$
\Phi = 2 \cdot \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)
$$

### A Word of Caution

While Phi's presence in various fields is indeed fascinating, it is important to exercise caution and avoid overextending its significance. This tendency, known as concordism, can lead to seeing Phi everywhere, even where it may not have any meaningful relevance.

### Political influence

It's worth noting that Phi is also the symbol used by the LFI, a French ultra-left party. This association is unfortunate, as it links such a remarkable mathematical constant to a political group that some may find disagreeable.

### Conclusion

Shane's explanation not only sheds light on the geometric construction but also underscores the surprising and multifaceted nature of Phi in both mathematics and graphics.
